## How LemonLoader Works

LemonLoader functions by **patching the target Unity game's APK**, injecting a bootstrapping routine that initializes its runtime environment before the original game code executes. This enables:

- Loading and executing **custom .NET assemblies (mods/plugins)**.
- Interacting with internal game functions and data structures using C#.
- Supporting both **Mono** (easier modding) and **IL2CPP** (complex native binaries) through advanced reverse-engineering tools like Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower and Cpp2IL.

This modular, injection-based design ensures high compatibility and modding flexibility across a broad range of Unity Android titles.
